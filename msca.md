## MSCA project 101107896: Systolic and diastolic estimates in geometry

This page will is occasionally updated with the highlights of my MSCA (aka Marie Curie) project, dedicated to

+ systolic freedom in manifolds;

+ bounds on diastoles, such as widths;

+ symplectic systoles: closed characteristics of minimal action.

Some of the current highlights include:

[Paper in JEMS on systolic freedom](https://ems.press/journals/jems/articles/14297929)

[Preprint, accepted to TAMS, relating widths with persistence diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13980)

[Notes with a packing perspective on Viterbo's conjecture]({{site.baseurl}}/files/viterbo.pdf)

An augmented reality visualization of this packing problem:
