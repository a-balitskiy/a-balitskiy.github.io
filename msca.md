## MSCA project 101107896: Systolic and diastolic estimates in geometry

This page is occasionally updated with the highlights of my MSCA (aka Marie Curie) project, dedicated to

+ systolic freedom in manifolds;

+ bounds on diastoles, such as widths;

+ symplectic systoles: closed characteristics of minimal action.

Some of the current highlights include:

[Paper in JEMS on systolic freedom](https://ems.press/journals/jems/articles/14297929)

[Video of my talk on Urysohn width at the GNOSC seminar] (https://www.carmin.tv/en/collections/not-only-scalar-curvature-seminar/video/waists-measured-via-urysohn-width)

[Preprint, accepted to TAMS, relating widths with persistence diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13980)

[Notes about a packing perspective on Viterbo's conjecture]({{site.baseurl}}/files/viterbo.pdf)

[Video of my talk on this packing perspective at a conference in Rio de Janeiro] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mIAkXNnqh4)
