## Marie SKLODOWSKA-CURIE ACTIONS --- Project 101107896 --- HORIZON-MSCA-2022-PF-01 

# Systolic and diastolic estimates in geometry

This page is occasionally updated with the highlights of my MSCA (aka Marie Curie) project, dedicated to

+ systolic freedom in manifolds;

+ bounds on diastoles, such as widths;

+ symplectic systoles: closed characteristics of minimal action.

Some of the current highlights include:

[Paper in JEMS on systolic freedom](https://ems.press/journals/jems/articles/14297929)

[Video of my talk on Urysohn width at the GNOSC seminar] (https://www.carmin.tv/en/collections/not-only-scalar-curvature-seminar/video/waists-measured-via-urysohn-width)

[Preprint, accepted to TAMS, relating widths with persistence diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13980)

[Notes about a packing perspective on Viterbo's conjecture]({{site.baseurl}}/files/viterbo.pdf)

[Video of my talk on this packing perspective at a conference in Rio de Janeiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mIAkXNnqh4)

An augmented reality visualization of this packing problem:

An applet displaying (almost) all polyhedra whose lagrangian product with the regular simplex has the properties of a symplectic ball:

The non-zero slider values have to form a connected graph on the vertex set {0,1,2,3}, but they can tend to zero with different speeds and it will result in different limit polyhedra. If moving sliders doesn't affect the polyhedron, try refreshing the page.
